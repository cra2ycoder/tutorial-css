# Elements Selectors

- This selector is just a case-insensitive match between the selector name and a given HTML element name
- This is the simplest way to target all elements of a given type

```html
<p>What color do you like?</p>
<div>I like blue.</div>
<p>I prefer BLACK!</p>
```

```css
/* All p elements are red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* All div elements are blue */
div {
  color: blue;
}
```
